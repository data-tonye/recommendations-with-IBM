# Recommendations-with-IBM
## Libraries used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pickle
- Collections
- Call

## Motivation
Recommendation systems are part of our daily lives and their primary aim is to be able to sort out relevant items for a customer creating a personalized experience for them on a given platform. Netflix is a popular example for this. It is important because when this is abused, echo chambers are created which can wreak havoc with some long term consequences on people or countries in the case of Facebook and other social media platforms.

## Files in repo
Data files: 
- articles_community
- user-item-interactions
- Pickle file: top_5.p, top_10.p, top_20.p (and user_item_matrix.p which is too large)
Test file: project_tests.py contain the tests for the project
Workspace files:
- Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb
- Recommendations_with_IBM.html

## Project Process
In this project, I explored the data, then used various recommendation methods to show how they can work in the real world. Recommendation methods:
I. Rank Based Recommendations
II. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
III. Matric Factorization

## Conclusions
This project successfully created models for a recommendation system using different methods. Futhermore, a flask app can be used to deploy and test these models.
